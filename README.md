NestaPress blogging theme
=========================

### Customisable, responsive blogging theme for the Nesta CMS.

NestaPress is a theme for Nesta, a [Ruby CMS](http://effectif.com/nesta). It is (being) designed and built by Jake Rayson as a general purpose blogging theme for his webiste <http://www.jrayson.co.uk>, incorporating such delights as:


* Responsive, HTML5, blah de blah  
* Scalable and Modular CSS  
<http://smacss.com>
* Responsive CSS3 slideshow that can hook in to Flickr.  
Something like <http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/04/25/pure-css3-cycling-slideshow/>
* Easy-to-choose sets of Google Web Fonts  
<http://www.google.com/webfonts/>
* Easy-to-choose colour palettes, along the lines of:

* Possibly an easy-to-add custom banner image
* A contact form that works!  
<http://bit.ly/sinatra-contact-form>

Mockups are created in [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org) using the [SVG format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics). Nice and open.
